# ====================
# General description 
# ====================

# A dynamical system consisting of an inverted pendulum on a cart.
# The state is fully determined as y=[x, dx/dt, θ , dθ/dt]
# Full nonlinear state can be determined using the Eular Lagrange equations
# System can be linearized about its fixed points and represented as:
# dy/dt= Ay + Bu
# Where Bu is a control input to be used to stabilize the system 



# ========================================
# Developing the RHS of the linear system 
# ========================================



function dy = cartPent(y,m,M,L,g,d,u)
    

    Sy=sin(y(3));
    Cy=cos(y(3));
    D=m*L*L(M+m*(1.0-Cy^2));
    dy(1,1) = y(2);
